                <h3>1. Data Protection at a Glance</h3>
                
                <h4 style="margin-top: 24px; color: var(--cyan);">General Information</h4>
                <p>The following information provides a simple overview of what happens to your personal data when you visit this website. Personal data is any data with which you can be personally identified. Detailed information on the subject of data protection can be found in our privacy policy below this text.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 24px; color: var(--cyan);">Data Collection on this Website</h4>
                <p><strong>Who is responsible for data collection on this website?</strong><br>
                Data processing on this website is carried out by the website operator. You can find their contact details in the section "Information on the Responsible Party" in this privacy policy.</p>

                <p><strong>How do we collect your data?</strong><br>
                On the one hand, your data is collected by you providing it to us. This can be, for example, data that you enter in a contact form. Other data is collected automatically or after your consent when you visit the website by our IT systems. This is mainly technical data (e.g. internet browser, operating system or time of page access). This data is collected automatically as soon as you enter this website.</p>

                <p><strong>What do we use your data for?</strong><br>
                Some of the data is collected to ensure error-free provision of the website. Other data may be used to analyze your user behavior.</p>

                <p><strong>What rights do you have regarding your data?</strong><br>
                You have the right to receive information free of charge at any time about the origin, recipient and purpose of your stored personal data. You also have a right to request the correction or deletion of this data. If you have given your consent to data processing, you can revoke this consent at any time for the future. You also have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data under certain circumstances. Furthermore, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 48px;">2. Hosting</h3>
                <p>This website is hosted by an external service provider (hoster). The personal data collected on this website is stored on the hoster's servers. This may include IP addresses, contact requests, meta and communication data, contract data, contact details, names, website accesses and other data generated via a website.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 48px;">3. General Information and Mandatory Information</h3>
                
                <h4 style="margin-top: 24px; color: var(--cyan);">Data Protection</h4>
                <p>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 24px; color: var(--cyan);">Information on the Responsible Party</h4>
                <p>The responsible party for data processing on this website is:</p>
                <p><strong>Agentryxx</strong><br>
                [Your complete address]<br>
                [ZIP Code] [City]<br>
                Germany</p>
                <p>Phone: [Your phone number]<br>
                Email: <a href="mailto:hello@agentryxx.com" style="color: var(--cyan);">hello@agentryxx.com</a></p>
                <p>The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g. names, email addresses, etc.).</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 24px; color: var(--cyan);">Storage Period</h4>
                <p>Unless a more specific storage period has been specified within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you assert a legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted, unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g. tax or commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, deletion will take place after these reasons no longer apply.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 24px; color: var(--cyan);">General Information on the Legal Basis for Data Processing on this Website</h4>
                <p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR, if special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9(1) GDPR. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also based on Art. 49(1)(a) GDPR.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 24px; color: var(--cyan);">Note on Data Transfer to the USA and Other Third Countries</h4>
                <p>We use tools from companies based in the USA or other third countries that are not secure under data protection law. If these tools are active, your personal data may be transferred to and processed in these third countries. We would like to point out that no level of data protection comparable to that in the EU can be guaranteed in these countries. For example, US companies are obliged to hand over personal data to security authorities without you as a data subject being able to take legal action against this. It can therefore not be ruled out that US authorities (e.g. secret services) process, evaluate and permanently store your data located on US servers for monitoring purposes. We have no influence on these processing activities.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 24px; color: var(--cyan);">Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h4>
                <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The lawfulness of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 24px; color: var(--cyan);">Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h4>
                <p>IF DATA PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 ABS. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR THE PROCESSING SERVES TO ASSERT, EXERCISE OR DEFEND LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 PARA. 1 GDPR).</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 24px; color: var(--cyan);">Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h4>
                <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work or the place of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 24px; color: var(--cyan);">Right to Data Portability</h4>
                <p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only be done insofar as it is technically feasible.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 24px; color: var(--cyan);">SSL or TLS Encryption</h4>
                <p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 48px;">4. Data Collection on this Website</h3>
                
                <h4 style="margin-top: 24px; color: var(--cyan);">Contact Form</h4>
                <p>If you send us inquiries via the contact form, your details from the inquiry form, including the contact details you provided there, will be stored by us for the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of follow-up questions. We do not pass on this data without your consent.</p>
                <p>The processing of this data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your request is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of inquiries addressed to us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if this has been requested.</p>
                <p>The data you enter in the contact form will remain with us until you ask us to delete it, revoke your consent to storage or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g. after your request has been processed). Mandatory legal provisions - in particular retention periods - remain unaffected.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top: 24px; color: var(--cyan);">Inquiry by Email, Telephone or Fax</h4>
                <p>If you contact us by email, telephone or fax, your inquiry including all resulting personal data (name, inquiry) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass on this data without your consent.</p>
                <p>The processing of this data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your request is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of inquiries addressed to us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if this has been requested.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 48px;">5. Plugins and Tools</h3>
                
                <h4 style="margin-top: 24px; color: var(--cyan);">Google Fonts (Local Hosting)</h4>
                <p>This site uses so-called Google Fonts, which are provided by Google, for the uniform display of fonts. The Google Fonts are installed locally. A connection to Google's servers does not take place.</p>
                <p>You can find more information about Google Fonts at <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq" target="_blank" style="color: var(--cyan);">https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq</a> and in Google's privacy policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en" target="_blank" style="color: var(--cyan);">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en</a>.</p>
