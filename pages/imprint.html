                <p>As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages according to § 7 Abs.1 TMG under general law. However, according to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we as a service provider are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.</p>
                <p>Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general law remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which a concrete infringement of the law becomes known. Upon becoming aware of such legal violations, we will remove this content immediately.</p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 32px;">Liability for Links</h3>

The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking.</p>
                <p>However, a permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of the law. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.</p>
